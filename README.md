## What is Algorave Club?

[algorave](https://algorave.com/) (from algorithm and rave) is making people dance to music generated by programming musical algorithms live. 

We are an afterschool club at [UTC Sheffield OLP](https://www.utcsheffield.org.uk/olp/) who code music in Python & Javascript, usually collaboratively, and always hacking our way to better tools.


## What we play
- [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/)
- [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/)
- [Gibber](https://gibber.cc/)

## Coding

We are working on improvements to FoxDot to make to it behave more how we like to.
