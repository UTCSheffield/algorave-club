## What is algorave

[algorave](https://algorave.com/) (from algorithm and rave) is making people dance to music generated by programming musical algorithms live. 

We code music in Javascript, Python & Haskell, usually collaboratively.

## What we play
- [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/)
- [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/)

## Coding

We are working on improvements to FoxDot to make to it behave more how we like to.
